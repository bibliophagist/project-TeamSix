       "'This paper presents a multi-modal framework for modelling and analysing different headway control strategies for improving bus service regularity. The interaction between buses and their surrounding traffic is captured in a multi-modal system through a Hamilton–Jacobi formulation of kinematic wave model. This paper further presents a set of signal-based strategies which regulate bus headway through adjusting signal timing plans. The results reveal that the capability of regulating bus headway disturbances through utilising traffic signals is important for maximising bus service regularity and coordinating the bus dynamics with surrounding traffic. This study generates new insights on managing bus reliability and multi-modal traffic in busy urban networks. © 2019, © 2019 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies Limited.'"

      "Existence and Ulam–Hyers stability for Caputo conformable differential equations with four-point integral conditionsIn this article, we investigate the existence and uniqueness of solutions for conformable derivatives in the Caputo setting with four-point integral conditions, applying standard fixed point theorems such as Banach contraction mapping principle, Krasnoselskii’s fixed point theorem, and Leray–Schauder nonlinear alternative. Further, we present Ulam–Hyers stability results by using direct analysis methods. Different types of Ulam stability, such as Ulam–Hyers stability, generalized Ulam–Hyers stability, Ulam–Hyers–Rassias stability, and generalized Ulam–Hyers–Rassias stability, are studied. Examples which support our theoretical results are also presented. © 2019, The Author(s). 3.422854177870249e-08\n",

      "The construction of solutions to Zakharov–Kuznetsov equation with fractional power nonlinear termsIn the paper, we study a plasma fluid physical model, namely the Zakharov–Kuznetsov (ZK, for simplicity) equation with fractional power nonlinear terms by the complete discrimination system for polynomial method, and give a detailed construction of all its single traveling wave solutions. The results show abundant traveling wave patterns of the ZK equation. © 2019, The Author(s). 3.422854177870249e-08\n",

We prove a finite time blow-up result of solution with positive initial energy as well as nonpositive initial energy under suitable conditions on the initial data and positive function g. © 2019, The Author(s). 3.422854177870249e-08\n",

      "A connection between weighted Hardy’s inequality and half-linear dynamic equationsIn this paper, we give an affirmative answer to the following question: Is the solvability of some nonlinear dynamic equations on a time scale T not only sufficient but in a certain sense also necessary for the validity of some dynamic Hardy-type inequalities with two different weights? In fact, this answer will give a new characterization of the weights in a weighted Hardy-type inequality on time scales. The results contain the results when T= R, T= N, and when T=qN0 as special cases. Some applications are given for illustrations. © 2019, The Author(s). 3.422854177870249e-08\n",
